## Project structure

```text
crates/
├── bark/        # Payment processor backed by a Bark wallet
├── ldk-server/  # Payment processor backed by an LDK Server node
├── lnbits/      # Payment processor backed by an LNbits wallet
├── spark/       # Payment processor backed by a Spark wallet
└── template/    # Starting point for integrating a new payment backend
```

Each processor has its own `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, configuration example,
and documentation. The crates intentionally do not share a Cargo workspace,
so dependency resolution and reproducible builds are independent.

Check or test every crate from the repository root:

```bash
for manifest in crates/*/Cargo.toml; do
  cargo check --locked --manifest-path "$manifest"
  cargo test --locked --manifest-path "$manifest"
done
```

Run an individual processor from its directory:

```bash
cd crates/template
cargo run --release
```
