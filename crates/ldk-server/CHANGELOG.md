## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A crate-local `Cargo.lock` and locked development commands for reproducible
  standalone builds.
- An opt-in regtest integration suite (`--features regtest-tests`,
  `just test-regtest`) that runs the backend and the processor binary against
  two real `ldk-server` daemons on a regtest `bitcoind`, covering BOLT11 and
  BOLT12 receive/send, held-HTLC failure semantics, invoice expiry,
  processor restarts, and a full Cashu mint/melt round trip. The daemon
  binary is taken from `LDK_SERVER_EXE` when set, otherwise it is cloned and
  built from the same upstream revision pinned in `Cargo.toml`.
- A `lib.rs` target exposing the `backend`, `error`, and `settings` modules
  so integration tests can exercise the backend directly. The binary now
  consumes the library instead of declaring the modules itself.

### Changed

- Updated the CDK integration to `0.18.0-rc.3` and payment-processor protocol
  4.0.0, including BOLT12 description capability advertisement and
  scheme-free client hosts.
- TLS mode now authenticates mint clients with `tls_client_ca_path`.
- Updated the documented `cdk-mintd` configuration for the 0.18
  database-authoritative payment-backend model.

- Replaced the `CDK_LDK_*` environment namespace with shared `SERVER_*`,
  `TLS_*`, and `ALLOW_INSECURE` variables plus backend-specific `LDK_*`
  variables. Environment values are now applied through Figment providers,
  and booleans accept only `true` or `false`.

### Fixed

- Outgoing LDK payment success and failure events are now correlated with CDK
  melt quote IDs, allowing pending melts to finalize or compensate instead of
  waiting indefinitely. The regtest suite also reports scenario progress and
  bounds Cashu melt confirmation waits.
- Unmatched outgoing LDK payment events are buffered and joined when the melt
  quote ID is registered, instead of polling the event stream. This keeps
  incoming payment notifications moving if a success/failure arrives before
  `make_payment` stores its correlation keys.
- The payment processor now fails closed without TLS unless plaintext is
  explicitly enabled with `allow_insecure`, warning more strongly when the
  effective bind address is not loopback.
